Come for NASCAR and see some of the Hoonigan car fleet. Event & ticket info here: https://bit.ly/3DkKtV9

Undefeated racer (at least on this show) Beto @ONDGAS returns from far-off Houston, and he’d like you all to meet Gator. Gator’s a simple “stock built” build with twin turbochargers, built Coyote engine, beadlock wheels for grip and “some” nitrous… “if we need it.” Meanwhile Robert’s Civic has a sweet K20 engine swap, a honkin’ 72mm Precision turbo, and is required by NHRA law to have a parachute. Who’s gonna win? And who’s lyin’??

Big thanks to NASCAR's Clash at the Coliseum for sponsoring this episode! https://bit.ly/3DkKtV9

Bengals in AFC Championship Game to advance to Super Bowl LVII | NFL | UNDISPUTED,"Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs got the 23-20 win over the Joe Burrow led Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC Championship Game to advance to Super Bowl LVII.
