Thanks to the @Switchbacksfc for hosting us! 

As soon as I heard that iShowSpeed‚Äôs birthday was coming up I knew that I had to be a part of it! That‚Äôs why I was stoked when Adin Ross reached out and asked if I could build him a custom Cristiano Ronaldo statue to surprise Speed with for his birthday livestream! You see, I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, Giant Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom, and a Real Life Squid Games Doll), but I've never built something made of triangles. The Beem Team and I decided to take things over the top for this by making the statue life size and wearing the uniform from the 2022 World Cup. To top things off, we only had 7 days to build it because everything is always last minute. After doing 20 hour days, we got barely got it done in time and had to deliver it accross the country to California. Both iShowSpeed and Adin Ross were AMAZED at how good the statue turned out turned out! This build was a real struggle to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. 

If you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre a real one! 
Comment ‚ÄúSpeed Loves Ronaldo!"" so I can notice you!
