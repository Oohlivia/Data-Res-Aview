LYRICS
Yeah, I got voices in my head again, tread carefully
And I don’t medicate, it helps me temporarily
I got problems, I got issues, yeah, apparently
Trauma that I’m burying
I think I need some therapy
I battle depression
I’m back with a message
I’m asking the question
That if you hate me
Why you actin obsessive?
I’m past the point of no return
Fuck being passive aggressive
I’ll brandish a weapon
Teach all you motherfuckers a lesson

I actually battle my demons and shadows
They swim in the deep and they creep in the shallows
I’m lost
I gotta admit that I’m living the life that I’ve always wanted 
But it comes at a cost
They’re lickin their chops
They're fixin to rip me apart
I’m swimming with sharks
I’m liftin the bar
I’m liftin it into the stars
I’m like a shot of adrenaline
Mixed with some Ritalin
You started a battle, but bitch, I'ma finish it
You think you can stop me, not even a lil bit
Nowadays, everybody’s so sensitive
Taking my words and you pick it a part
Trippin on nothin just get in the car
Grippin n rippin, I'm stickin the mark
I’m tippin the charts

'Cause I got enemies trying to get rid of me
Evil tendencies are fucking with me mentally
I got people that don’t like me in the industry 
I can feel your energy, you are not a friend to me

'Cause I have been to places that you never wanna go
I got dirt on people, but they act like I don’t know
I could do some damage, but I’ll never rock the boat 
All it takes is one post, watch 'em fall like dominoes

You’ll never get rid of me
Too many mini me’s
Rippin my imagery
You know my history
It ain’t a mystery
I put every enemy outta they misery
Somebody send me some positive energy
About to go Darth, about to go Disney
Into the darkness, into infinity
And shut you motherfuckers up
You listening?

Stackin every little pretty penny that I’m getting
And I’m never giving In to anybody, always winning
Never kidding, when I die
I’m takin everybody with me
You’re never gonna get me 
'Cause you’ll never see it simply
I’m a motherfucking god
You’re a light yawn
I’m a time bomb
And the vibes wrong
Is this mic on?

I’m killin the syllables
With a loaded refillable
I’m a lyrical typical supervillain
I’m venomous
And I’m never gonna stop until
They put me on top of the list

I can’t control the monster any longer that’s inside

The pain and sorrow
Left us hollow
No tomorrows
Hard to swallow
Death is calling
So appalling
Tightrope walking
Now I’m falling down
Like missiles falling from the sky
Come and save us
The pain and sorrow 
Left us hollow
Here today but gone tomorrow

The pain inside is the fuel that drives
This flesh and bone through
Blood red skies 
(hahaha)
The death defying
Hypnotizing
One day you’re gonna figure out
That everything they taught you was a LIE
Watch The World Burn

The fear is what keeps you alive
Break the fucking chains, take back your life
The fear is what keeps you insane
Break the fucking chains
Take away the pain

Let's Start Here's appeal isn't owed to the novelty of Yachty going psych rock. That he clearly did his homework and was inspired to put his own spin on these sounds is the impressive part.

Lyrics:
Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth
Just talk about life goin' sip for sip
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah my, my friends say let her go
Your friends say what the hell
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else 

Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough 
I can’t remember everything we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

I know you said this time you really weren’t coming back again,
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet. 
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night
